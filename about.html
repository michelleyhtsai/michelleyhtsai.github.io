I'm a data enthusiast based in the Netherlands who specializes in analyzing financial and marketing content.

I enjoy taking complex problems and turing them into valuable and informative reports. I also love to explore AI, sustainability, and e-commerce related topics.

When I'm not pondering business issues, you will find me doing yoga or photographing with my Nikon camera.
