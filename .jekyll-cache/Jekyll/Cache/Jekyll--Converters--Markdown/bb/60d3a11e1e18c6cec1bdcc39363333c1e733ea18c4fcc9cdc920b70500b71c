<p>The definition of predictive analytics on Wikipedia is: ‚Äúan area of statistics that deals with extracting information from data and using it to predict trends and behavior patterns‚Äù. There is increasing use of predictive analytics in business due to the growth of data. Although the characteristics of the humanitarian sector are different from the commercial area, predictive analytics is still fundamental to building useful information systems which help mitigate the risks for humanitarian responses. Following are some examples of utilizing predictive analytics.
First, data and algorithms can conduct trend analysis and predict which populations are vulnerable to risks, then help build an early warning system to alert for disasters [1]. Since the Indian Ocean tsunami, the early warning system has been constantly upgraded to cope with the increasing natural disasters, minimizing the impact of disaster [2]. Next, combined with GIS tools and stochastic descent algorithms, geospatial analytics helped prioritizes specific preventative activities in precise geographic locations and found out approximately 84,000 deaths or 15.7 million cases of malaria could be prevented over 5 years [3]. Therefore, disaster-prone countries could make use of these technologies for better preparedness for the crisis.
Additionally, historical data and predictive models could help in building better simulation platforms to improve the training qualities [4]. Building professional local capacity is always a difficult and crucial subject. With the help of high-quality simulation systems, it could help train the humanitarian workers more effectively and further enhance the efficiency of response. Furthermore, big data and predictive analytics have proved to be effective in boosting coordination and trust between different actors in humanitarian logistics [5]. For example, it helps personnel to better assess strategies, take corrective action and give people more confidence to face future challenges. Data visualization tools also help in better communication between parties.
Lastly, OCHA has listed predictive models that have been used in the humanitarian sector on its website [6]. As seen in the explanation chart, lots of predictive models achieve high accuracy and reliability, so can be used as a good reference for preparedness. Take the Cholera prediction modeling system, for example, Yemen government can use this model (with 92% accuracy) to coordinate resource and pre-position inventories. Nevertheless, one of the challenges of predictive analysis is that good quality data is hard to find, and most of the data is unstructured so it takes time to collect and organize.</p>
