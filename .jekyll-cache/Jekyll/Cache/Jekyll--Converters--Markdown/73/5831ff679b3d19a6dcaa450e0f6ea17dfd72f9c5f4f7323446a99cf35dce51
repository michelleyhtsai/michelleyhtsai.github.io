<p>The first reason perhaps lie in the delivery methods. The delivery of medicines relies on the government health care system; however, the governments of Africa usually lack the experience to build a good supply chain system to deliver the medicine, and especially have difficulties with the last mile delivery. On the other hand, Coca-cola is an international company that has over a hundred years of professional experience in delivering its goods. Because of the companyâ€™s great resources and knowledge in supply chain and marketing, they know how to distribute their products to households.</p>

<p>Coca-cola and medicines are different in nature. Coke is a kind of consumer good that everyone can sell, but medicines are usually regulated by the government only specific institutes like pharmacies and hospitals can possess and distribute them to people. However, health institutes are usually scarce in Africa, and the distribution of the institutions is not even. Thus, even if the residents want to purchase medicines, they do not know where to seek help.  It needs the collaboration of different parties to solve this problem. Coca-cola currently has a project called Project Last Mile. On their website, they mentioned that they have partnered with governments and NGOs to improve the condition of medicine delivery issues in Africa.
