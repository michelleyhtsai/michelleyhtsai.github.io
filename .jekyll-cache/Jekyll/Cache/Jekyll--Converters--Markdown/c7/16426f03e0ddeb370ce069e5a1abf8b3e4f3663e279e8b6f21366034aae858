<h2 id="product-1-amsterdam-budapest-june-14-june-18-1-person-direct-flight-economy-class-from-klm">Product 1: Amsterdam-Budapest (June 14-June-18), 1-person, direct flight, economy class from KLM</h2>

<p>Roughly speaking, the price was stable for the first 4 weeks, which ranged between â‚¬330 and â‚¬338; however, the price suddenly dropped in half in the last 3 weeks, which ranged between â‚¬146 and â‚¬153. As known, the aviation industry has been dramatically impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic during this period, so I would put a large emphasis on the influence of Covid in the analysis.</p>

<p>Below I discussed the possible reasons in terms of two aspects,</p>
<h3 id="1-consumer-demands-and-behaviors">(1) Consumer demands and behaviors</h3>
<p>The big drop in the ticket price between 12th Apr and 19th Apr is possibly due to both governments of Hungary and the Netherlands announcing to lift numerous lockdown restrictions and anticipating that life would go back to normal by the start of July with the proposed roadmap. As the dates of the flights are in mid-June, the airline could therefore predict that most restrictions are already lifted at the time. This implies that people are more willing to travel because they can visit travel attractions, restaurants, and shops as usual after nearly a half of year of lockdown. Thus, the airline cut down the prices as it predicted that there would be a high increase in demand after the lockdown lifting news. 
Also, the prices are cut hugely because KLM needs to make their product more compatible in the market. It is reasonable to assume that after the announcements, every airline would increase their flights and adjust the ticket prices in a way more similar to the situation before the pandemic. As airline tickets tend to have higher price elasticity, especially for the customers who would buy the economy class, KLM needs to make a huge decrease in price to prevent the customers choose other airlines or destinations. Here, KLM demonstrated a good example of using dynamic pricing to adjust ticket prices based on demands.</p>
<h3 id="2-capacity-control">(2) Capacity control</h3>
<p>To maximize revenue, airlines such as KLM repeatedly use the idea of multi-fare systems to calculate protection levels and bid prices by considering the current number of available seats and the latest demand forecasts. (Li et al., 2014) 
Apart from the decreasing demand, KLM needs to take extra considerations during the Covid time. First, a social distancing policy decreases capacity, which in turn brings up so many questions. For exampleâ€” How many seats to block? How to better compute the protection level? Would customers perceive economy class differently now when social distancing means bigger space? Other policies such as PCR tests also increase the chances of cancellation and no-shows. Due to the decreased capacity and the high uncertainty of the seats, the costs of a single flight increased. To prevent the potential loss and maximize the revenue, KLM had to price the tickets high until the governments were certain about lifting the lockdown restrictions.</p>

<h2 id="product-2-nintendo-switch-new-gray-model-from-bolcom">Product 2: Nintendo Switch New Gray Model from Bol.com</h2>

<p>Looking at the graph, the price of the Nintendo Switch is rather stable in the first three weeks, then it increased by nearly â‚¬40 at week 4; however, the price dropped continuously from â‚¬418 to â‚¬329 in the last four weeks.</p>

<p>Nintendo uses dynamic pricing to price Nintendo Switch. The company allows different online sellers (in this case, Bol.com) to revise its product price in response to changes in demand patterns. Unlike other retail industries, the gaming consoles industry is unique as only Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox appear and dominate the industry. The demand is largely driven by the release of new games and new consoles by each company.</p>

<p>The price trend of the Nintendo Switch can be possibly explained by the following 2 reasons,</p>
<h3 id="1-the-release-of-an-epic-game">(1) The release of an epic game</h3>
<p>Monster Hunter Rise is a new title of the epic Monster Hunter series that was released worldwide on 26th March. It is also exclusive for Nintendo Switch only, which means customers can only play the game on Switch, not on PlayStation or Xbox consoles. 
A piece of Japanese news stated that the game sold over 1.3 million copies within its first week of sale in Japan, and it also led to a surge in Switch unit sales. Therefore, this could be the biggest reason that could explain the surge in the price of the Nintendo Switch on Bol.com in week 4. To cope with the sudden huge demand, the online seller had to increase the price. Here, the seller needs to consider the unconstraining issue. As the demand is predicted to be large and the seller only has limited inventory, the seller should plan quickly to order more Switch consoles from Nintendo.</p>
<h3 id="2-the-release-of-the-new-nintendo-switch-console">(2) The release of the New Nintendo Switch console</h3>
<p>The current Switch model hasnâ€™t been updated for four years. The reason for the decreasing price in the last four weeks is probably that there were rumors about Nintendo is planning to launch Nintendo Switch Pro in late 2021. In April, there was an increasing number of news and discussions about Switch Pro release dates and new features. 
The concept of markdown pricing could be used to explain this decreasing price trend. As customers are willing to wait for the launch of the brand-new console, their willingness to pay for the current console decreases when times went by.</p>
